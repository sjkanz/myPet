# myPet
This is a game I created back in high school that centered around taking care of pets. It was originally coded in Repl.it, and has since been copied over to here. This is created completely in Java, and is a personal project that was both for fun and to reinforce my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming. Here is the original link to Replit: https://replit.com/@EmmiedaCat/My-Pet
